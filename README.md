# Personal Scripts Repository
This repository is a collection of various scripts written in Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, AutoHotkey, and other programming languages. These scripts have been created for my personal use and are tailored to my specific environment and workflow.

## Disclaimer
Please note that these scripts are highly specific to my setup and might not be directly useful to others. However, feel free to use them as a reference, modify them, or learn from them for your own projects or specific tasks. These scripts are used to automate various tasks on my computer or on web servers. The automation ranges from simple tasks, such as changing directories or opening files, to more complex operations like automatically organizing my emails or downloading and processing videos from the internet. Each script should have comments or a brief description to help you understand its purpose and how it works.
