# Personal Scripts Repository
This repository is a collection of various scripts written in Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, AutoHotkey, and other programming languages. These scripts have been created for my personal use and are tailored to my specific environment and workflow.

## Disclaimer
Please note that these scripts are highly specific to my setup and might not be directly useful to others. However, feel free to use them as a reference, modify them, or learn from them for your own projects or specific tasks. These scripts are used to automate various tasks on my computer or on web servers. The automation ranges from simple tasks, such as changing directories or opening files, to more complex operations like automatically organizing my emails or downloading and processing videos from the internet. Some scripts might have comments or a brief description to help you understand its purpose and how it works.

The scripts favor functionality and practicality over robustness and security, so you may need to be careful before trying to run them on your own. If I need a certain output, I will hardcode my specific requirements instead of making it generic for different kinds of inputs. This speeds up my code writing process and my workflow, but may create a need to update the code if different inputs are desired. For instance, my currency conversion script currently only accepts BRL and USD. It could be generalized for more currencies, but that requires changing the code.
